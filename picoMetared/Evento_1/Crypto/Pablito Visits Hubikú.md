---
## Objectivo

Pablito took a visit to Hubikú, a huge cenote near to Chichen Itzá in Yucatán. While Pablito was swimming in the darkest part of the cenote, a little light coming out from a Wall of rocks caught his atention.

As he explored the Wall, he found a series of paintings, rare ones, so Pablito instead of calling the authorities, he decided to take a picture and Google it to find out what does it mean.

Help Pablito to make the discover of the century.
